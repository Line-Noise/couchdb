Apache CouchDB DEVELOPERS
=========================

Only follow these instructions if you are building from a source checkout.

If you're unsure what this means, ignore this document.

Dependencies
------------

You will need the following installed:

 * GNU Libtool            (http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/)
 * GNU Automake (>=1.6.3) (http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/)
 * GNU Autoconf (>=2.68)  (http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/)
 * GNU Autoconf Archive   (http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf-archive/)
 * pkg-config             (http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config)
 * GNU help2man           (http://www.gnu.org/software/help2man/)

# @@ pkg-config

# @@ autoconf-archive

# @@ deps for docs

The `help2man` tool is optional, but will generate `man` pages for you.

Debian-based (inc. Ubuntu) Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can install the dependencies by running:

    apt-get install libtool automake autoconf autoconf-archive pkg-config help2man

Be sure to update the version numbers to match your system's available packages.

Mac OS X
~~~~~~~~

You can install the dependencies by running:

    brew install libtool automake autoconf autoconf-archive pkg-config help2man

# @@ check these packages are correct

# @@ check other files don't use MacPorts

You will need Homebrew installed to use the `brew` command.

Bootstrapping
-------------

Bootstrap the pristine source by running:

    ./bootstrap

You must repeat this step every time you update your source checkout.

Testing
-------

Check the test suite by running:

    make check

Generate a coverage report by running:

    make cover

Please report any problems to the developer's mailing list.

Releasing
---------

The release procedure is documented in the project wiki:

    https://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Release_procedure

Unix-like Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configure the source by running:

    ./configure

Prepare the release artefacts by running:

    make distcheck

You can prepare signed release artefacts by running:

    make distsign

The release artefacts can be found in the root source directory.

Microsoft Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configure the source by running:

    ./configure

Prepare the release artefacts by running:

    make dist

The release artefacts can be found in the `etc/windows` directory.

Until the build system has been improved, you must make sure that you run this
command from a clean source checkout. If you do not, your test database and log
files will be bundled up in the release artefact.
